# Chapter 3 - useful approaches

## Dynamic programming

It's a technique how to make faster recurrent algorithms.

It's **applicable** in case when:

- it's recurrent
- it has overlapping problems
- input is ordered

**Downsides:**

- still have not much meaning in solving NP-complete problems
- we don't know sequence which lead us to the result

## Divide and conquer

It's a techinique of solving algorithms through separating input on two or more parts.

For example, _merge sort_, _MapReduce_.

## Randomization

Some algorithms use random numbers to solve problems. Correctness of using it is proven using statistics.

For example, _quick sort_, _fast exponentiation_.
