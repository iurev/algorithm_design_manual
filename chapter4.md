# Graphs

![Graph](http://webmathematics.net/images/six%20nodes.jpg)

Graph is a data structure used to store relationships between elements.

Components:
- Vertices (nodes or points)
- Edges (arc or line)

Properties and types:
- Weighted or unweighted
- Directed or undirected
- Cycled or acyclic
- Planar or non-planar
- Biconnected
- Bipartite

## Applications

- Networks
- Topology
- Sociology
- Lexical analysis

Many functions are implemented in special graph databases.

## Implementation

Relationships between nodes can be stored in:
- Matrixes
- Adjacency lists

## Difference with trees

Actually, tree is an acyclic connected graph. They were “invented” after trees.

## Traversal

- Breadth-first
- Depth-first

### Breadth first

- Cheney's algorithm for tracing garbage collection
- shortest path
- testing a graph for bipartiteness
- Maze generation algorithm
- Analysis of networks and relationships

### Depth first

- topological sorting
- Maze generation

## Minimum spanning trees

Minumum spanning tree is when vertices are connected with minimal possible weight.

## Shortest paths

- Dijkstra
- All in pairs
